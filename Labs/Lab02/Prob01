1-Becuase sometime we not need to put in queue we just watch the queue of eventhandeler and check if 
current event was processed it will queue the event in callback after last I/O


2-We use setImmediate if we want to queue the function behind I/O event callbacks that are already in the event queue.
Use process.nextTick to effectively queue the function at the head of the callstack so that it executes immediately after the current function completes.



3-Error,Buffer,NaN,Promise,Set
Array,http,url,stream,net
